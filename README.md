## Some Useful Installation Tips

If you have already installed python 2.7 install python 3 as well but it may be the problem that the packages installed with respect to python 2.7 and shows error for the python 3 packages,

So you need to install virtual Environment for the python 3 to install python3 packages.

```
    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 py3env
    source py3env/bin/activate
    pip install package-name
```

After setting virtual environment install packages listed above and Enjoy.
